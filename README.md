This project combines a number of skills from the React course: fetching from APIs, React Router, Prop Type Checking, CSS modules, and React testing with mocked functions, modules, and get requests. 

Overall, this was a fun project and definitely helped teach me more about how React applications work, specifically by managing state between components.
